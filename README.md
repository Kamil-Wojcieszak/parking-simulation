# Project NiDUC, PWR 2023
The project's topic is the Reliability of a Repairable Series-Parallel System - MTTF, MTBF.

The project will analyze a repairable series-parallel system. The automatic parking system will be evaluated, which consists of the following components: barriers, inductive loops, ticket machines, automatic cashiers.

The planned outcome of the project is to determine the reliability of the parking system for different parameter values and identify weak points in the system that require improvement. The aim is also to optimize the system's costs and propose ways to improve reliability.
